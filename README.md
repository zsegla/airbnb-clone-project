## Project Overview
This clone recreates the core booking flow of AirBnB:

1. **Discovery** – filterable property catalog  
2. **Exploration** – immersive listing pages with photos and amenities  
3. **Booking** – secure checkout and confirmation  
4. **Management** – authentication, wish‑lists, and past trips (stretch)

The codebase is fully open‑source for learning and team collaboration.

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- **Create an intuitive booking flow** that guides users smoothly from browsing to checkout.
- **Maintain visual consistency** throughout all pages to ensure a professional and trustworthy experience.
- **Ensure fast loading times** by optimizing images, code, and interactions.
- **Prioritize mobile responsiveness** so users can comfortably browse and book from any device.

### Key Features
- **Property search and filtering** with dynamic and responsive controls.
- **Detailed property viewing** with images, amenities, pricing, and booking options.
- **Secure checkout process** that captures user details, payment, and confirms bookings.
- **User authentication** (signup, login, logout) to personalize user experience.

### Primary Pages

| Page Name               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View   | Displays a grid of available properties with filters such as price, location, and amenities. |
| Listing Detailed View   | Shows full property information including images, descriptions, ratings, and a booking form. |
| Simple Checkout View    | Provides a clean interface for entering payment details and confirming the booking. |

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is essential in a booking system because it:
- **Reduces friction** in the user journey, making it easier to complete a booking.
- **Increases conversion rates** by guiding users with intuitive interactions and minimal distractions.
- **Improves customer satisfaction** with a seamless, responsive, and visually appealing experience.
- **Encourages return usage and referrals** due to a trustworthy and professional interface.

### Figma Design Specifications

#### 🎨 Color Styles
- **Primary Color**: `#FF5A5F` – used for call-to-action buttons and key highlights
- **Secondary Color**: `#008489` – used for links, active states, and secondary buttons
- **Background Color**: `#FFFFFF` – page background and component containers
- **Text Color**: `#222222` – main heading and paragraph text
- **Secondary Text Color**: `#717171` – subtitles, metadata, and muted text

#### 🔤 Typography
| Type             | Font Family | Font Weight | Font Size |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Primary Text     | Circular    | Medium (500)| 16px      |
| Headings (H1–H3) | Circular    | Bold (700)  | 24px–32px |
| Secondary Text   | Circular    | Book (400)  | 14px      |

> Note: If the Circular font is unavailable in the implementation, system-safe or Google Fonts like **Inter**, **Poppins**, or **Nunito Sans** can be used as substitutes.

### Why Identifying Design Properties Is Important

Understanding and extracting design properties (like colors, typography, spacing, and components) from a Figma mockup is crucial because:

- ✅ **Consistency**: Maintains visual and interaction consistency across pages and components.
- 🎯 **Developer Alignment**: Ensures developers translate design accurately into code.
- 📱 **Responsiveness**: Helps adapt designs for various screen sizes early in development.
- 🧩 **Reusability**: Enables creation of reusable UI components that follow a unified style guide.
- 📐 **Efficiency**: Reduces back-and-forth between designers and developers during implementation.

By referencing Figma's styles directly, we ensure our application looks and feels like a polished product.

## Project Roles and Responsibilities

To ensure smooth collaboration and clear task ownership, the following roles are defined within the team:

| Role               | Responsibilities                                                                                 |

## UI Component Patterns

To build a scalable and maintainable frontend, the project will use reusable UI components. These components ensure consistency and simplify development across different pages.

### Planned Components

- **Navbar**
  - Includes the site logo, search bar, user navigation (login/profile), and a responsive menu for mobile devices.
  - Ensures easy navigation across the platform.

- **Property Card**
  - Displays property image, basic details such as price, location, rating, and a favorite (bookmark) button.
  - Designed with a responsive layout to fit different screen sizes.

- **Footer**
  - Contains site links, company information, social media icons, and copyright information.
  - Provides consistent information and easy access to secondary navigation.

Each component will be designed with reusability and accessibility in mind to maintain a consistent user experience throughout the application.
