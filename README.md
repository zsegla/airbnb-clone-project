## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- **Create an intuitive booking flow** that guides users smoothly from browsing to checkout.
- **Maintain visual consistency** throughout all pages to ensure a professional and trustworthy experience.
- **Ensure fast loading times** by optimizing images, code, and interactions.
- **Prioritize mobile responsiveness** so users can comfortably browse and book from any device.

### Key Features
- **Property search and filtering** with dynamic and responsive controls.
- **Detailed property viewing** with images, amenities, pricing, and booking options.
- **Secure checkout process** that captures user details, payment, and confirms bookings.
- **User authentication** (signup, login, logout) to personalize user experience.

### Primary Pages

| Page Name               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View   | Displays a grid of available properties with filters such as price, location, and amenities. |
| Listing Detailed View   | Shows full property information including images, descriptions, ratings, and a booking form. |
| Simple Checkout View    | Provides a clean interface for entering payment details and confirming the booking. |

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is essential in a booking system because it:
- **Reduces friction** in the user journey, making it easier to complete a booking.
- **Increases conversion rates** by guiding users with intuitive interactions and minimal distractions.
- **Improves customer satisfaction** with a seamless, responsive, and visually appealing experience.
- **Encourages return usage and referrals** due to a trustworthy and professional interface.

### Figma Design Specifications

#### üé® Color Styles
- **Primary Color**: `#FF5A5F` ‚Äì used for call-to-action buttons and key highlights
- **Secondary Color**: `#008489` ‚Äì used for links, active states, and secondary buttons
- **Background Color**: `#FFFFFF` ‚Äì page background and component containers
- **Text Color**: `#222222` ‚Äì main heading and paragraph text
- **Secondary Text Color**: `#717171` ‚Äì subtitles, metadata, and muted text

#### üî§ Typography
| Type             | Font Family | Font Weight | Font Size |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Primary Text     | Circular    | Medium (500)| 16px      |
| Headings (H1‚ÄìH3) | Circular    | Bold (700)  | 24px‚Äì32px |
| Secondary Text   | Circular    | Book (400)  | 14px      |

> Note: If the Circular font is unavailable in the implementation, system-safe or Google Fonts like **Inter**, **Poppins**, or **Nunito Sans** can be used as substitutes.

### Why Identifying Design Properties Is Important

Understanding and extracting design properties (like colors, typography, spacing, and components) from a Figma mockup is crucial because:

- ‚úÖ **Consistency**: Maintains visual and interaction consistency across pages and components.
- üéØ **Developer Alignment**: Ensures developers translate design accurately into code.
- üì± **Responsiveness**: Helps adapt designs for various screen sizes early in development.
- üß© **Reusability**: Enables creation of reusable UI components that follow a unified style guide.
- üìê **Efficiency**: Reduces back-and-forth between designers and developers during implementation.

By referencing Figma's styles directly, we ensure our application looks and feels like a polished product.

## UI Component Patterns

To build a scalable and maintainable frontend, the project will use reusable UI components. These components ensure consistency and simplify development across different pages.

### Planned Components

- **Navbar**
  - Includes the site logo, search bar, user navigation (login/profile), and a responsive menu for mobile devices.
  - Ensures easy navigation across the platform.

- **Property Card**
  - Displays property image, basic details such as price, location, rating, and a favorite (bookmark) button.
  - Designed with a responsive layout to fit different screen sizes.

- **Footer**
  - Contains site links, company information, social media icons, and copyright information.
  - Provides consistent information and easy access to secondary navigation.

Each component will be designed with reusability and accessibility in mind to maintain a consistent user experience throughout the application.

## API Security

Ensuring security across backend APIs is vital to protect user data and maintain platform integrity. The following measures will be implemented:

- **Authentication**
  - Users must log in to access protected routes using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication.
  - Ensures that only valid users can make requests on behalf of themselves.

- **Authorization**
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts actions (e.g., only hosts can add properties).
  - Prevents unauthorized data manipulation.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Limits the number of API requests per IP/user to mitigate DDoS attacks or abuse.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**
  - Protects against common web attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF.

- **Secure Payments**
  - Payment data is handled via a secure third-party provider (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).
  - Ensures PCI compliance and encrypted communication.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) automates the process of integrating code, running tests, and deploying updates to production. It ensures faster development cycles and higher code quality.

### Tools Used:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing, linting, and deployment steps whenever changes are pushed.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistency by running the application in isolated containers.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS**: (Optional) Platforms used for hosting the production or staging environment.

> Implementing CI/CD improves reliability, minimizes human errors, and ensures that new features are deployed safely and efficiently.
